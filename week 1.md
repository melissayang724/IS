1. Think about the last app you used on your phone. What are its core hardware, software, and data components? What problem does it solve for you?

App: Line (a messaging app)

Problem Solved: Line allows me to communicate instantly with family and friends, no matter where they are. It solves the problem of distance and time, allowing for both casual chats and important conversations. Additionally, it helps me manage multiple conversations through group chats and enables media sharing (photos, videos) easily.

2. Imagine you have to create a new information system for your favorite coffee shop. How would it help the staff with their processes? Who are the key people who would use it?

System Purpose: A comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) system for order taking, payment processing, inventory tracking, and customer loyalty management.

3. The material says IS helps organizations gain a competitive advantage. Can you think of a company that uses an IS so well it seems like their secret weapon? What makes their system so special?

Example: Netflix

What Makes It Special:

Data Analytics & Personalization: Netflix uses an advanced recommendation system that analyzes user behavior, watching history, and ratings to provide personalized movie and show recommendations. This keeps users engaged and reduces churn.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): Netflix has invested heavily in a global CDN to ensure high-quality streaming across different regions, making its service fast and reliable.

Machine Learning: The system continuously learns from user interactions, adapting the recommendations in real-time based on changing preferences and trends.

Competitive Advantage: By leveraging data and AI, Netflix can stay ahead of competitors and create original content that appeals to global audiences.

4. You're the "people" component of an IS. A new system is being implemented at your workplace, and it's making your job harder, not easier. What would you do? How would you communicate your concerns?

Action Steps:

Identify Specific Issues: I would first pinpoint the exact challenges the new system is creating. For example, is the interface too complicated? Does it require more manual input? Is it slow?

Document Examples: I would document instances where the system fails to perform well or causes delays. This helps in presenting clear evidence of the issue.

Communicate Concerns to Management or IT: I’d arrange a meeting with my supervisor or IT department to explain the problems. I would present the specific issues I’ve identified and suggest potential solutions (e.g., interface improvements, training on the system, or more customization options).

Offer Constructive Feedback: It’s essential to frame the feedback in a constructive way, emphasizing how improving the system can enhance productivity for everyone involved.

5. What's one everyday problem you have that could be solved by a simple IS?

Problem: Managing daily expenses and staying within a budget.

How It Would Work:

The app would allow me to input expenses (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment) and categorize them.

It could automatically generate monthly summaries, showing how much I’ve spent in each category and comparing it to the set budget.

The app would send notifications if I’m about to exceed my budget, helping me stay on track.

Over time, it could provide insights on where I spend the most, helping me make smarter financial decisions.
