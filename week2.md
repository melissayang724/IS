# Information in Your Bank App: When you check your banking app, you see your current balance. What is the raw data that had to be collected and processed to generate that single piece of information (your balance)?
In your bank app, **data** refers to raw details like individual transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) and account activities. **Information** is the processed result, like your current balance, which is calculated by summing all relevant transactions.
 # The 'System' of Online Shopping: Describe your process for buying a textbook online (from search to checkout). Identify one piece of hardware and one piece of software that is essential for this system to function.
To buy a textbook online, I search for the book, add it to my cart, enter payment info, and check out. A smartphone (hardware) and the shopping app or website (software) are essential for this process.
 # 'People' as IS Components: Think about your experience with university registration. Who are the different "People" involved in that system (not just you), and what unique process does each person enable?
 In university registration, **students** choose courses, **advisors** guide selections, and **admin staff** manage schedules and records. Each plays a key role in keeping the system organized and running smoothly.
 # From Data to Actionable Information: You use a fitness tracker (or health app). What is one type of raw data it collects, and how does the system transform it into actionable information that makes you change your behavior?
A fitness tracker collects **step count** as raw data. It turns this into **daily activity reports**, showing progress toward goals, which can motivate you to walk more.
 # Failure of Integration: Describe a time when two systems (e.g., your university email and the course system) failed to work together smoothly. Was this a failure of data, software, or process integration? Explain briefly.
 Once, my course registration didn’t update in my university email, so I missed class notices. It was a **process integration** failure—systems weren’t synced properly to share updated info.
 # The Process of Creating "Information": When you write a weekly summary for a class project, you are acting as an Information System. Which step in your process (e.g., filtering, synthesizing, summarizing) is the most critical for turning data into quality information?
 **Summarizing** is the most critical step—it turns detailed data into clear, useful information that others can quickly understand.
 # Hardware's Invisible Role: Beyond your personal computer, where does the crucial hardware for a large-scale system like LINE or WeChat actually reside? Name one type of hidden hardware and its function.
Crucial hardware for apps like LINE or WeChat resides in **data centers**. One key hardware is a **server**, which stores data and handles message delivery.
# Software as the 'Logic': Imagine a simple elevator system. The software is the logic. If the elevator ignores a call because it's full, which part of the IS definition is the software enforcing? (Hint: Think about rules).
The software is enforcing the system’s **rules/processes**—it follows logic to skip a call when the elevator is full.
 #Identifying a True Information System: Is a simple spreadsheet (like a Google Sheet) used to track inventory a complete Information System? Using the full definition (H/S/D/P/P), what is it missing or what component is the weakest?
A simple spreadsheet tracks data but lacks full **processes** and **software** for automation, so it’s not a complete Information System.
# The Purpose of IS in Your Career: Based on the IS purpose (support decision-making, communication, operations), which of these three goals will be the most valuable to your future job in Information Management? Why?
In Information Management, **supporting decision-making** is most valuable because it helps use data to make smart, informed choices.
